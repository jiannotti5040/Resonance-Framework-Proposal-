## Abstract

This repository contains documentation for a theoretical framework proposing a novel, O(1) constant-time algorithm for prime number prediction.

## Core Hypothesis

The core hypothesis is that prime distribution is a projection of a geometric 'Resonant Manifold.' The theory proposes that a prime's properties can be mapped to this manifold, allowing for its position to be calculated directly, rather than found via a search-based method.

The full theory, including a multi-volume philosophical calculus, related concepts on AI governance, and system optimization, is detailed in the included White Paper and Compendium documents.

## Author & Status

This is the work of an independent, self-taught researcher.

The concepts herein are unproven, have not been subjected to formal academic peer review, and likely contain errors or arbitrary assumptions that require professional correction.

## Prototype

The included `.html` and `.py` files are **non-functional prototypes.** They are provided **only** to illustrate the general logic of the proposed predictive function and framework.

The prototypes fail because they lack the necessary calibrated parameters, which would need to be derived and validated from the theory's core principles.

## Call for Peer Review Outside Academia

This theory is presented to the whatever community wants to look any and all are welcome. 

The framework requires analysis to determine if the core concept is viable and to properly define its mathematical structures.
